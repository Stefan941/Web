            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
            galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
            also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        </li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-adjust"></i>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
            in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
            Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
            consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
            discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
            Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
            the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
            sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-adjust"></i>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
            those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also
            reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
            Rackham.</li>
