                        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                            Ipsum has been
                            the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
                            galley
                            of
                            type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                            but
                            also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                            popularised
                            in
                            the 1960s with the <span>release of Letraset sheets containing</span> Lorem Ipsum passages,
                            and more
                            recently
                            with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a
                            piece of
                            classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                            McClintock, a
                            Latin

                            words,
                            consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                            classical
                            literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

                        <p>Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
                            Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
                            theory of
                            ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
                            dolor
                            sit
                            amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
